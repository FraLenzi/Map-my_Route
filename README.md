# Map-my_Route
Project carried out for "Foundamentals of signals and transmissions" course during my Bachelor degree with other students.
The goal of the project was to map the path of a person using a telephone in a park using the delay in the peaks of the autocorrelation functions. Everything was simulated on Matlab and performed through increasingly complex guided steps.
